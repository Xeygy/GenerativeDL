Strain broth through a fine-mesh sieve into bowl with gelatin and stir to dissolve. Season with salt and pepper. Set bowl in an ice bath and cool to room temperature, stirring. Toss ham with reserved parsley and divide among jars. Pour gelatin on top and chill until set, at least 1 hour. Whisk together mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Stir in celery, cornichons, and potatoes. Pulse peas with marjoram, oil, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a food processor to a coarse mash. Layer peas, then potato salad, over ham.\n"
