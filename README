# Generative AI Workbook
## ðŸ‘‹ Howdy! 
This repo is for me while I work through 
David Foster's Generative Deep Learning, 2nd 
Edition. I'll be working through the examples 
in the book by translating them to Pytorch 
(the book is implemented with Keras). 

The reason for the translation is that I want to 
avoid  a common issue that I've faced with tutorials, 
where I'll read through a tutorial and breeze 
through it, thinking I understand everything,
while missing the nuances and detail that I'd need
to actually implement the code on my own.
So hopefully this act of translation will allow
me to sidestep this issue and better understand the
concepts in the book.
